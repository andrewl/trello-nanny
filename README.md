Trello Nanny
============

Trello is a great lightweight project management tool, but managing multiple boards and users isn't as easy as it could be. This simple tool just posts a notification in slack if a user is a member of zero or more than one card. All configuration is in config/trello-nanny.config (the example file should be copied and should contain your tokens and ids where appropriate).
